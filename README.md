# NotesPlugin
Plugin for [WebFramework](https://github.com/pmpwsk/WebFramework) that adds a simple notes app for users.

There is also a manifest so most browsers should offer installing this plugin as a progressive web app (PWA).

Website: https://uwap.org/projects/notes-plugin

Changelog: https://uwap.org/changes/notes-plugin

## Main features
- Creating, editing, saving/discarding and renaming notes
- Searching for notes by name or day
- Creating folders for notes with unlimited depth

## Installation
You can install this library to your WF project by downloading a .dll file or the source code and referencing it in your project file. In the future, there will be a NuGet package.

If you're using the source code, you will need to update the project reference to WebFramework according to where you have it. The reference will soon be replaced with a NuGet dependency so the library becomes smaller and you don't need to reference WF manually.

Once installed, add the following things to your program start code:
- Add <code>using uwap.WebFramework.Plugins;</code> to the top, otherwise you have to prepend it to <code>NotesPlugin</code>
- Create a new object of the plugin: <code>NotesPlugin notesPlugin = new();</code>
- Map the plugin to a path of your choosing (like any/notes): <code>PluginManager.Map("any/notes", notesPlugin);</code>

You can do all that with a single line of code before starting the WF server:<br/><code>PluginManager.Map("any/notes", new uwap.WebFramework.Plugins.NotesPlugin());</code>

## Plans for the future
- Moving notes
- Sharing notes publically or privately
- Allowing other users to edit certain notes
